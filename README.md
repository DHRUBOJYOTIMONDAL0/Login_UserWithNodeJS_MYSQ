Steps to Set Up a Node.jsProject with MySQL for User Login
Install Node.jsand npm: First, install Node.jsand npm on your local machine using the following command:

bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm
Initialize a Node.jsProject: Navigate to your project directory and run:

bash
npm init
Install MySQL Package: Install the MySQL package using npm:

bash
npm install mysql
Create a Database Connection: In your project, create a file (e.g., database.js) and configure your database connection:

javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: 'your-hostname',  // e.g., 'localhost'
    user: 'root',           // Change to your MySQL username
    password: 'your-password',  // Use your MySQL server password
    database: 'nodejs'      // Provide your own database name
});
Install Express: Install the Express framework:

bash
npm install express
Install Body-Parser: Install Body-Parser to handle incoming request bodies:

bash
npm install body-parser
Port Configuration: Ensure your MySQL server port number does not conflict with your application port. For example, if your MySQL port number is 3306, choose a different port for your application, such as 3000.

Run Your Application: Navigate to the directory containing your main application file (e.g., login.js) and start your application with:

bash
node login.js
This should provide a clear and structured set of instructions for setting up a Node.jsproject with MySQL for user login.
